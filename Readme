Contributions

Q: I want to sen pull request for the project. Will you accept it?
A: If the pull request adds some functionality or fixes bug - yes. But make sure, that you wrote the code with using the next rules:

	CSS:
	1)  Write the colors always as rgba-format. It's easier to recognize the color after that. Plus because of transparent functionality and easier "lighter-darker" stuff.
	2)  Write the full path (like "html > body > div#hd a.example") for fast finding the block. I don't want to spend hours to find the block on the page.
	3)  Leave comments. Even if it obvious. Because it's the only way to understand what this thing does after the 6 months (or two bottles).
	4)  Leave comments in English. I don't want to see the squares when I use my calculator to browse the code.
	
	JavaScript:
	I'm not so good in JavaScript, but here is some rules:
	1) Leave comments. In English.
	2) DO NOT CHANGE idadder.user.js.
		Exception: If you will change all used id marks in all other code - go on.
	3) Use BSD code-style.
	4) When attaching the inner js to blocks, use "\" to divide it in source to a several lines and make it readable.

Q: May I use this proje...
A: Yes.

Q: May I sell...
A: Yes, don't bother me.

Q: How about to change the...
A: Send me pull request or go to hell.

Q: Why do you need idadder.user.js?
A: For identifying the blocks. For example, change the "Форум" caption at http://www.linux.org.ru/forum/ page, but don't change "Информация о..." at http://www.linux.org.ru/people/username/profile page. Got it?

Q: Why don't you merge idadder.user.js to lorputer.user.js?
A: To have a possibility to use it in another project. For me, for you, blah, blah, blah. It's a feature.

Q: I have a mac and reti...
A: My apologies.
